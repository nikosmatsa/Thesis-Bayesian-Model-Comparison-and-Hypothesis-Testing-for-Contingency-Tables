# Thesis-Bayesian-Model-Comparison-and-Hypothesis-Testing-for-Contingency-Tables
Thesis of AUEB Department of Statistics (Applied Statistics)


With this thesis we explore the Bayesian framework in Statistics for model comparison, we implement variable selection, prior distribution selection comparison and hypothesis testing in contingency tables using R and Stan which is an imperative modelling programming language for Bayesian Statistics using the sophisticated gradient-based MCMC method.
In the first chapter we introduce to the reader the bayesian methodology and the process of Bayes Factor calculation given the historically research that has been done and we present examples produced using Stan in R.
In the second chapter we present the probability structure in contingency tables, the distributional sampling (design) of them and how we implement independence test and some of the most important statistical measurements like odds ratio, risk ratio and difference in proportions using conjugate priors.In the third chapter we dive in the Generalized Linear Models world, through the conjugate prior analysis of logistic regression, log-linear models, multinomial and ordinal models.In chapter 4,we introduce to the reader the idea of penalised likelihood for model comparison.AIC,BIC and DIC are the main criteria of interest along with the Leave-One-Out cross validation  criterion, that has been created as a model comparison process, examining the  expected predictive accuracy of the models produced in Stan.In addition in  chapter 5  we examining the dependent observations for Matched Pair models. Symmetry, marginal homogeneity,Kappa coefficient, McNemar test are subjects that are concerning scientists in  many fields of science and in this chapter we present the probabilistic approach of them with Bayesian analysis.
